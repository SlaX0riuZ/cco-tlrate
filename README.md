# CCO-tlrate
An all-in-one graphical program for calculating Tally Credit Rates.
## Features
### Multi-Window Style
Includes separate windows for data entry, graphed data, and a confirmation for data deletion.

### External Data Storage
Simplistic text-document data recall and storage, allows for your inputs to be saved on exit and reload.

### Interactive Graphics
The graph is based from the "Matplotlib" database, making it intuitive to understand.

## HowTo

### Data Entry
Simply use the provided text buttons and checkboxes to input your data.
#### The "Combined Pizza/Holeys" inputs requires to add up all of the levels of the sigils on each of your cubes.
Ex: You have 3 T7 Holeys, 1 T6 Holey, and 2 T5 Pizzas. You'd input "27" for the Combined Holey Tier, and "10" for the Combined Pizza Tier.

### Data Deletion
There is a button in-program to delete all of your data when neccessary.
If you really need to do something super precise, you can always enter the text file...

### Graphical Aspects
The provided graph shows your Tally Credit per Spin UPKEEP; provided perfect conditions.
(Those being that you reclaim your Tally Laborers exactly when they are full.)
#### Each other bar corresponds to the Spin Cost of each amount of +Box Mods, the numbers on top are each of their values.
For simple interpretation, find which number is higher than your upkeep; you can keep your tally credits spinning 1 below that.
